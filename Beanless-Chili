Ingredients :- (sorry about the absurd imperial values)
1lb bacon (chop finely)
1lb red onions (diced finely)
5lb Beef Brisket (cube to about 4cm)
1/3 Cup Hot Chilli Powder
1 Lrg Heaped tablespoon minced garlic (world foods aisle does this in jars much easier, if not the smoked garlic is best)
1 Lrg Heaped Tablespoon Cayenne Pepper
1 Tablespoon Cumin
1 Tablespoon Ground oregano (leaf is ok too just chop finely)
1 Tablespoon sea salt (reg salt is fine too)
1 Tablespoon Black Pepper

Chillis.. this is the judgement call, originally I used 3 of the half size cans of green chillis (in brine I think), 
but also like a dozen of the large carrot like green chillis, or a couple of small jars of the preserved ones work well, 
at any rate, green chile peppers is where its at. 
this is where the primary flavour comes from but the heat is from the cayenne and chilli powder mainly.

3 bottles corona beer (comes in packs of 4, youll want to keep the fourth and not just keith floyd it while cooking, you can add it later for extra liquid.
Tomatos,.I like to use fresh but you can use 28oz (just shy of 800g) of tinned. 
if fresh just quarter them up theyll break down in the cooking process so youre just looking at making the skin bits smaller)

1 of the small cans of tomato puree (or a tube)
1 Oz of high cocoa chocolate (green and blacks works well, and then you can eat the rest of the bar, chop up a bit)


Prep all the stuff and have it to hand, makes life easier in a minute--Start with a big old skillet/pan in it goes the bacon, onion and garlic, mix it all up, cook til the bacon is cooked through and the onions are browning, then rake it all into...A BIGASS POT! something like a 15litre stockpot, the chilli will reduce down a lot in cooking but has a lot of initial volume.Add everything else and bring it up to boil once its at a hrard boil bring it down to a mediumish heat and cook for two hours, youll need to attend to it a LOT, especially if your pot isnt non stick, bring up the stuff from the bottom so it doesnt settle,  make a blanket acrosss the bottom of the port and burn badly, this is critical otherwise youll ruin the entire batch (well as much as you can ruin chilli, tbh its still  mainly fine, just tastes a bit scorchy).after two hours settles it to a low simmer and cook it til the meat is falling apart  into strings, again stirring it often (this is why i dont cook it much, you're basically devoting half a day to beign a cooking bitch, telly in the kitchen helps)And that's it.I recommend white rice, a little bit of lime, and some grated mature cheddar. Rach likes cornbread with it. Also it keeps well in the fridge, great with jacket spuds.
