Coddle

Casserole dish, ideally one you can heat on the hob (dutch oven etc)

pack of sausages (8 usually) cut each in half/thirds
potatoes, peeled and sliced ~1cm thick (twice the amount as sausages by weight) (900g)
back bacon, approx half weight of sausages (225g)
1 large onion per 8 sausages, cut into large chunks
Carrots peeled and sliced, same volume as sausages
salt and black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped parsley (approx per 8 sausages)
500ml chicken stock, or 500ml sweet cider and 2 chicken stock cubes (per 8 sausage) crumbled in


heat the dish, partly cook the bacon and sausage pieces, until just before the outside of the sausages brown 
(you can brown them if you prefer, but normally they should be pale) 
if you cannot heat your dish on the hob, do the same in a pan, then rake into a seperate bowl, layer as below.


remove half the meat mix, add half of the other ingredients as a layer
layer the removed meat back in, and layer the rest of the ingredients on top
pour over the stock or cider and stock cube mix.

cover with lid, cook in a low oven (180C , gas mark 3) for about 90 minutes
remove lid, and dot the top with butter,cook for a further 3 minsute with the lid off to allow the top to crisp
