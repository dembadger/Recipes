A good easy way to make use of a cheap pork shoulder.

Ingredients 
1 Pork shoulder (or other similar cut)

per kilogram of shoulder :
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder (or 1 garlic clove, crushed)
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 chicken stock cube
125ml pineapple juice
125ml orange juice
1/2 chopped red onion


these figures do not need to be exact, it is perfectly fine to just round up to the nearest kilo.

Method : 
Cut up the shoulder into roughly 4cm cubes, leave the fat on, it will render out as it cooks.
Add all ingredients to the pressure cooker, give them a stir to make sure they are well mixed.
cook on high pressure for 1hr10mins, allow to naturally depressurise.

Optional : 
You can serve these immediately by straining off the liquid, however should you want crispy edges and fat, drain the meat cubes off, and place under a hot grill until they have dried off and gones sligthly crispy


Serve with wraps, in a rolls, with rice, however you like really, if you find them a bit fatty, a squirt of lime juice helps balance this out.
