Prepare the roast pork in the manner of wild boar by first wiping the meat, then sprinkling it with cumin several hours before cooking. Roast uncovered in a 350degree F oven, 35 min per pound.

For the sauce, grind together pepper, celery seed (or lovage), caraway, fennel, and rosemary (or rue). Blend with stock, red wine, and butter or olive oil. Put the sauce in a pan, bring to a boil, then simmer slowly for 25 minutes. Thicken with flour.

Remove the finished roast from the oven and sprinkle it with celery seed. Serve slices of meat with the sauce.
